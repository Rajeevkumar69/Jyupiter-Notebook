                              ‚≠ê&nbsp; Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-based interactive computational environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific
                              computing.
                         </p>

                         <p>‚≠ê&nbsp; Jupyter Notebook documents are called notebooks, and they are saved as JSON files with the <code>.ipynb</code>&nbsp; extension. Notebooks are made up of a sequence of cells, each of which can contain code, text, or both.</p>
                         <p>‚≠ê&nbsp; Code cells can be executed in order, and the output of each cell is displayed below it.</p>
                         <p>‚≠ê&nbsp; Text cells can be used to add markdown formatting, equations, and other non-code content to the notebook.</p>

                         <p>‚≠êJupyter Notebook is available for a variety of programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and JavaScript. It can also be used to interact with other computational systems, such as Apache Spark and Hadoop.</p>
